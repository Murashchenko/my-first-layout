Often, companies don't know where to start... Clearly, though, to succeed,
electronics OEMs need to make closing the gap a real priority.
"It has to be an organization wide initiative," said Eshkenazi.
"It can't be the flavor of the month or window dressing." To that end, the push for fair hiring practices
for women has to start with the leadership team and be supported by human resources initiatives, he added.

Corporate culture and hiring practices have to evolve to meet
the needs of a more diverse work force, Eshkenazi said. "As you bring in different demographics,
including religious, gender, or other groups of diverse individuals, you have to be responsive and
understand that certain employment practices will resonate with different individuals," he added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
According to the survey, women have several clear priorities when it comes to their careers.
In fact, 44% pointed to challenging/interesting assignments as a key priority, while 40% wanted an
attractive salary package. With 26% of the mentions, good work/life balance was also a clear priority for many.
                  </p>
                  <p>
Similarly, there are a number of factors that make women flee their manufacturing jobs.
Half of those surveyed pointed to a handful of concerns that might cause them to consider leaving the industry:

The works of the talented artist from New York Murrou Ethan (Ethan Murrow) are so realistic that they
are often confused with monochrome images. These
drawings are so amazing that even if we consider them for a long time, is still a question that is still not a photo.
                </p>
                <div class="post__full-content">
                  <p>
Murrou uses photography and film to create their own large-scale graphite drawings. Armed with a stack of paper
and pencil, the artist creates their own unique detail on pencil drawings, while forgetting about everything and head
goes to work. Therefore it is no surprise that these works of art evoke admiration, not only art, but also surprise.
"It seems to me that there is a delicate line between reckless obsession and a great success", - he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
Thanks to his talent, creative approach to work and patience Murrou manages to create stunning masterpieces that
bewitch others. It is worth noting that the artist's work is often published in renowned magazines around the world.
In addition, the author has managed to gather a large "army"
of fans who eagerly await the new works of art by Murrou.

  Multi-column layout CSS - a great feature that allows you to split a block with text in multiple columns.
  Usually, very long lines hard to read if you have to think too long to move from the end of one line to the beginning of
  another, it is easy to lose the desired line. To save space on the screen, but at the same time to
  make the text readable, can be divided into one continuous block of text into multiple columns, as is done in the newspapers.
                </p>
                <div class="post__full-content">
                  <p>
Already in all popular
modern browsers, you can use multi-column CSS layout. Let's consider the basic properties that allow you to create a column.
                  </p>
                  <p>
The first of them - <code>column-count</code>. This property
takes an integer parameter and divides the block of text by a predetermined number of columns of equal width to each other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
column-width property sets the minimum desired <code>column width</code>. If column-count has not yet been set,
the browser will automatically divide the text in a number of columns, so that they fit into all of the available width.
                  </p>
                  <p>
The value of the positive and set in px, em, pt or any other CSS units of length.
Note that if a single string may include 45 to 75 characters to be legible, it is recommended to adhere width
40-50 characters for text columns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
there is a gap between the columns. Recommended gap width default 1em.
But it can be changed using the properties of the <code>column-gap</code>. Units also px, em, pt, and others.
                  </p>

Flexbox - this is the first CSS-mechanism for meshing and creating complex layouts blocks. Other mechanisms by which we
used to build the grid, thought not for this: floating blocks needed to create a block that wraps around the text and tables
are used for layout of tabular data.

Specification CSS Flexible Box Layout Module is designed to change the situation for the
better in dealing with the enormous number of tasks. Flexbox allows you to control
the size of the order and alignment of elements on several axes, the distribution of space between the elements, and more.

Flexbox thought to create "flexible" layout and keeps a lot of the subtleties
and wonders, which we discuss in this series of courses. In the meantime, start with a simple. How to enable Flexbox?
                  </p>
                  <p>
It's very simple: you have to set the element <code>display: flex;</code>. After that there are two events:
                  </p>
                  <ol class="post__o-list">
                    <li>The element with the <code>display: flex;</code>
                      It turns into "flex-container" and inside it starts to happen all the magic of flexible layouts.
                    <li>Direct descendants of this element are transformed into "flex-elements" and
                      begin to play by new rules.
                  </ol>
                  <p>
The first thing you will notice after doing this job is that the blocks are spread
over the entire height of the container. Yes, you can do inside Flexbox elements of the same height!

Entrepreneur and journalist Jeffrey Goines wrote in his blog a note about how to achieve the goals. In 1975, Bill
Gates founded Microsoft. But it wasn’t until six years later that he landed a contract with IBM. Then, it took
another five years after that for the company to go public, making Gates a multimillionaire, resulting in his
so-called “overnight success.”

For Steve Jobs, it took even longer. With Steve Wozniak, he started Apple Computer in 1976 but didn’t make a
splash until 1984, with the release of the Macintosh.
Then there was his eventual ousting and comeback — all before his business became the global giant it is today.

A third well-known tech history, just for good measure: Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin
found success slow in coming, too. They started the company in 1996, and it wasn’t until eight years later
that their search engine beat past competitors,
leading Google to finally go public with a market capitalization of $23 billion.

This is consistent with what researcher K. Anders Ericsson calls his theory of “deliberate practice”
and the “10,000-hour rule” Malcolm Gladwell subsequently popularized. In his research,
Ericsson argued that for someone to become an expert in their field, they need at least 10,000 hours of practice.
In other words, before you quit your job or make your next career transition,
take your time building the skills you’ll need to do that job well.

There is something charming and attractive in Victorian homes. Yes, beauty has its price: the abundance of different
details in the interior and exterior, as well as the diverse décor creates a lot of difficulties in care. House
Victorian poorly to any kind of change and
fit only a certain type of personality, that is those people who will be able to appreciate the skill and quirks old time.

                      <h2>Skillful execution of elements</h2>
Are they a window frame or decorate a graceful arch, all of these various curls and flourishes
guarantee otherness of one house to another.
                    <li>
                      <h2>Unwritten permission to paint the house in any color</h2>
In Victorian homes have a very interesting feature. They may be colored in almost any color without losing
their real beauty. Owners tend to hold low-key tones and the external design of the building, but there are exceptions.
                    <li>
                      <h2>The ladder that "voices" every step</h2>
Old wooden ladder can boast not only beautiful and original pattern on the stairs, but his squeakiness.
Most of the ladders in these homes are equipped with elegant railings that are and ask someone to them moved out.
                    <li>
                      <h2>Unique wooden products</h2>
Today, such a fine wood work will cost a pretty penny, it is provided that you will find a wizard that will take for it.
                    <li>
                      <h2>The room, which is always dark</h2>
Some rooms in the Victorian houses sometimes seem too tight, and even narrower. Despite the abundance of windows,
the light can not penetrate
into the room. Is this an advantage? It is unlikely, but the candlesticks, chandeliers and lamps easily correct position.
                    <li>
                      <h2>Interior, which makes keeping your back straight</h2>
Large dining table, majestic moldings or imposing
portrait of an ancestor with a disapproving look - all this makes sitting with his back flat and your head held high.
                    <li>
                      <h2>The room, which is used only for rest (if not used)</h2>
People loved their Victorian reception and living rooms, but most prefer to rest in a separate room
                    <li>
                      <h2>Furniture with unknown original purpose</h2>
Victorian style furniture is rich and interesting ornaments. Today (and then)
not urgent need for an ornate bench with a mirror, as in the photo, but such things are admired for their beauty.
                    <li>
                      <h2>Secrets</h2>
Usually they are hidden in the panels, floorboards or among other components.
If you can not find a hiding place in a Victorian house, then you are just looking bad.
                    <li>
                      <h2>Ghosts</h2>
What looks bizarre day, it may look ominous night. Most likely, at least one child in the neighborhood is afraid of the house.

William Kentridge has decided to revive
the Tiber embankment wall to the day of the founding of Rome, creating a large-scale painting titled "Triumph and defeat."

This is an unusual graffiti of up to 12 meters in height and 550 meters in length, it depicts a procession of 80 characters
from antiquity to the present day. The number of characters includes a variety of historical figures, among them Romulus and
Remus, the founders of which are considered legendary.
Also on this frieze I found a place the writer and director Pier Paolo Pasolini, whose body was found in 1975 near Rome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
The project was implemented with the support of dealers Kentridge - Goodman Gallery, Galleria Lia Rumma, Marian Goodman
Gallery. The discovery of the frieze was marked by a series of performances, as well as the performance of more than 40
musicians and shadow theater performance.

 Dark silhouettes were created from layers of concentrated coal dust caused by using water cannons and giant plastic stencils
 on the walls of gray limestone embankment. In the world of street art such technique is called "reverse graffiti". But,
 unfortunately, this work can not long
 survive, since a maximum of 5 years after it rains washed away, and if you still frieze continues, it will hide dust and dirt.

  Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables,
  mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.

I do not like CSS. It is simple and intuitive. This is the driving force of the Internet, but it is too limited and it is
difficult to manage. It's time to put this language in order and make it more useful by using dynamic CSS using LESS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
I will explain my position with an example. Why, instead of using FF9F94 # to obtain a dark peach color just does not store
the value of this color in a variable for later use it? To repaint the site will be enough to change the variable all in one
place and all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
In other words, it will be very elegant, if we use a little bit of programming and logic in CSS, that would make it a more
powerful tool. Well, it's all possible with LESS.

Unless you're tracking expenses carefully, it can be hard to tell whether your city's cost of living or
your own spending habits are the cause of your financial troubles. Using the 50-30-20 budgeting rule,
for example ― in which 50 percent of income covers necessities, 30 percent is for discretionary items and
20 percent is saved ― you can quickly determine whether your income is sufficient to cover expenses for living
in your city. If it isn't, you might have to cut costs or maybe even move.

GOBankingRates conducted a cost-of-living comparison of the 75 most populous U.S. cities, surveying dollar amounts
of living expenses including rent, groceries, utilities, transportation and healthcare. This total, which accounts
for necessities, was then doubled to find how much money a single person needs to earn in that city to follow a
50-30-20 budget. This study also compares the total amount of income needed to the actual
median household income in each city to see if differences in cost of living are matched by differences in pay.

  The simplicity and elegance. Japanese style interior. Mat, bamboo, paper lamp, sliding partition - this is what we recall
  in the first place when it comes to the interior in Japanese style. In fact, all this is nothing more than a building
  material. This Japanese interior starts with the traditions and ceremonies, the main philosophical idea which
  - to renounce all worldly things, and indulge in the enjoyment of tranquility and contemplation of the hidden beauty.

The layout of the Japanese home - the emphasis is on space and functional mobility. The shape of the room is
usually right - a square or rectangle. All functional elements visually hidden: cabinets built into niches so that their
doors would be positioned flush with the wall and sliding partitions made during the entire length of the wall. The same
pattern finishes, rolling off the walls in the sliding partitions makes the border between them invisible. Rooms are separated
by a mobile sliding partitions. Stationary partitions little. It is noteworthy that the outer wall of the house facing the
garden,
too, is a mobile or removable. This is to ensure that would be to remove the partition in the summer and enjoy the garden.
                  </p>
                  <p>
Japanese housing can seem empty due to the fact that the Japanese use very little furniture. The rooms do not have
traditional tables, chairs, sofas. All things are hidden in embedded closets, and the Japanese more accustomed to sitting on
the floor. Therefore floors are covered with tatami -. Mats certain size, height 5 cm Tatami stacked in the correct order.
;Improper positioning as the Japanese believe brings misfortune to
the house. Tatami can not lay the correct grid, there should be places where converge the angles of the three or four tatami.
